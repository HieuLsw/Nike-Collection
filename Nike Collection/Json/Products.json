In this pack we’re seeing both silhouettes kind of trade places in a way that we’ve never seen them before. The Air Jordan 29 ditches the traditional performance woven upper and uses leather, which is typically used on the Air Jordan 1. A full Black upper colors the kicks with University Red accents adding a nice pop. Then the Air Jordan 1 goes for a Black performance woven upper, that we traditionally see used on the Air Jordan 29. White and University Red accents complete the second offering from this pack."
